# WebScrapping_whitepages
Webscrapping whitepages website to get the contact details

This python script uses "requests" and "BeautifulSoup" to do web scrapping. Please note that it is just a process of automating name search in Whitepage.com and grabbing the details like name and address. It is just a mini project which limits data search results with only 8-9 pages. It can be extended to include all search results. 

This code assumes that the names to be searched for are given as a list in csv file. Script will fetch names one by one from csv and search for it in whitepages.com to get the address details.
